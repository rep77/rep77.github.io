            <p>“Help me, internet strangers. You’re my only hope.”</p>
            <p>Hi, everyone. I’ve got a problem. I think my husband of sixteen years is cheating on me. In the past month, I’ve gotten a lot more texts like this: “Problem at work. It’s going to be a long night. Don’t stay up waiting for me. Love you.” And almost every time, the next morning, I find a note on the kitchen counter saying that he had to get to work early to deal with the “problem.” I’m starting to think this “problem” is another woman! I’ve always been skeptical of his assistant, Cindy, but I never thought my husband would do anything with her—or anyone!</p>
            <p>Should I confront my husband about my suspicions? Or should I do some digging to find proof? I don’t know what else to do. Please help me out.</p>
