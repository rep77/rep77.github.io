        <h3>Design Concept</h3>
          <p>As a soon-to-be professional creator who will be entering the work force shortly, I have been thinking a lot about what I want my “brand” to be. My main passions are writing and photography, and I hope to combine these two to create a unique, innovative brand. However, I haven’t figured out how to do that quite yet, so I will focus this assignment on general ideas that I want to incorporate into my website regardless of how I define my brand.</p>
          <p>I think the most important component of website design is ease of use. Page navigation should be simple and seamless. For example, the menu bar must be recognizable and ever-present on every page of the site without crowding the screen. The menu items themselves should be appropriate, specific, and self-explanatory. (What these items are depends on what content I decide to put on my website.) Depending on how many menu items I have, I might include a footer area for an “about me” section, contact information, and social media links. If I use my website for blogging, I will include a subscription box somewhere on the main page.</p>
          <p>It is also valuable to consider the aesthetics of a website because people instinctively “judge a book by its cover.” Neutral or muted colors work best with the eyes; too much vibrance or saturation is bound to cause fatigue and generally looks unappealing. I am personally a fan of earthy tones—olive, tan, periwinkle, rust—which will pair well with my photography since I primarily photograph nature. Speaking of pictures, there should be a nice balance between text and images so that one does not overpower the other. These images may include graphic illustrations/designs. In regard to text, I want to use a variety of fonts so long as they all work together visually. They should be eye-catching but easily readable.</p>
          <p>Thinking about the color scheme of my site has helped me realize what I want its overall design to be. What I love about nature is that it is both simple and intricate at the same time. For example, a rock is quite boring on its own but can be majestic when part of a formation or landscape. The same sky that everyone unconsciously ignores can make people stop in their tracks at the right time of day. I’m not sure how I’m going to translate that to a website design, but I want the layout of my site to evoke a similar feeling/idea: engaging but comfortable, draws you in but isn’t “in your face.” I’m envisioning a kind of creative minimalism: cleanness and simplicity meets personality and imagination.</p>
