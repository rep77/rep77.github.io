		<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>Describing people is difficult. We are complex, multidimensional beings, but we often reduce our existence to labels: daughter, student, artist, scientist, American, immigrant—the list goes on. If I conformed to that stereotypical—and, quite frankly, superficial—custom, my introduction would look something like this:</p>
			<p>Hello, world. My name is Reena Patel. I am a 19-year-old girl from southern California, but I am now located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where I am studying psychology and English writing at the University of Pittsburgh.</p>
			<p>Well, that was alright, but I’d prefer it to go more like this:</p>
			<p>Although I am “grown up,” I still have not decided what I want to be, besides a genuinely good human being—but one would argue that is not exactly a career. What I do know, however, is that my heart is full of love for a great number of things, including (but not limited to) books, writing, nature, photography, dance, and—most importantly—people. I hope to nurture these passions throughout my life, both within and outside of whatever career I may acquire. This website is a reflection of my journey.</p>
			<p>In reality, I am sure you do not care how you learn about me—whether it’s through a surface-level synopsis of my life or an intimate glimpse at my character—but I have included both approaches here for your convenience. Do with them what you please. All I hope is that I have enticed you enough to stick around and explore my page.</p>
